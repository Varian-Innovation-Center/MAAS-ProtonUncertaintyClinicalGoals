# MAAS-ProtonUncertaintyClinicalGoals
This project's purpose is to evaluate the planâ€™s Clinical Goals against the doses for all of its uncertainty scenarios. 
Additionally, the script records some patient and field details, and calculates normal tissue complication probabilities (NTCP) for a couple of endpoints.

The source code for the project as presented in the 2023 AAPM Proton Symposium can be found in 2023AAMD_Proton_Symposium_Source_Code

This repository will work to offer updated versions of this project with precomiled binariuers for your specific Eclipse version in the future.
